Commenting out unwanted rules in css files

Non-complete ANTLR grammar for css.

For now, it parses the css of the [Intel app framework](http://app-framework-software.intel.com/) (> 4500 lines of css)

The idea is to be able to comment out unwanted css rules, without resorting to monkey patching or countering css rules in the framework.
